## 📊 Dashboard Visuals
1. **CO2 Emissions Over Time**: An interactive line chart showing CO2 emissions trends over the years. Users can zoom in on specific periods and filter by country or region.
   
2. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Source**: A bar chart that breaks down emissions by source (e.g., transportation, industry, agriculture). Hover over bars to see detailed statistics.

3. **Global Map of Emissions**: A choropleth map visualizing emissions data by country, allowing users to compare regions globally.

4. **Sector-wise Emissions Analysis**: Pie charts and tree maps for a detailed breakdown of emissions by sector, enabling users to quickly identify the biggest contributors.

5. **Key Insights Section**: Summarizes key findings and trends, helping users to quickly grasp the most important insights from the data.

## 📈 How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Interact with Charts**: Click, hover, and filter across various charts to explore detailed data.
2. **Use Filters**: Apply filters to focus on specific regions, time periods, or emission sources.
3. **Navigate Easily**: Use the sidebar and navigation tabs to quickly switch between different views and visualizations.
4. **Download Data**: Export visualized data for further analysis or reporting.
